Hello, there once was a little girl, her name was Ruby.
She did not like to be creative.
She had a brother who biomedically engineered dragons.
The dragons liked to eat her homework. =(
And the teachers did not believe her.
But one day, the school decided to host a bring your pet to school day.
So Ruby decided to bring her brother's dragon to school.
