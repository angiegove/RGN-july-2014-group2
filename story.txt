Hello, there once was a little girl, her name was Ruby.
She did not like to be creative.
She had a brother, Michael, who biomedically engineered dragons.
The dragons liked to eat her homework. =(
This made Ruby very upset, so she complained to her brother. 
Michael apologised to his sister, and asked what he could do to make it better.
Ruby convinced Michael to bring one of his prize dragons, Emerald, to her school.
At Ruby’s school, Michael told the teacher what happened, showing how pieces of Ruby’s 
homework was still stuck in Emerald’s teeth.
