Hello, there once was a little girl, her name was Ruby.
She did not like to be creative.
She had a brother, Michael, who biomedically engineered dragons.
The dragons liked to eat her homework. =(
This made Ruby very upset, so she complained to her brother.
Michael apologised to his sister, and asked what he could do to make it better.
Ruby convinced Michael to bring one of his prize dragon, Emerald, to her school.
At Ruby’s school, Michael told the teacher what happened, showing how pieces of Ruby’s
homework was still stuck in Emerald’s teeth.
And the teachers did not believe her or Michael.
But one day, the school decided to host a bring your pet to school day.
So Ruby decided to bring her brother's dragon to school.
Then her brother brought the dragons to the school. Mwhahaha!
And she thought, finally she could prove Emerald had been eating her homework.
So her brother brought the dragon to the school. Mwhahaha!
